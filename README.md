## Technique Inspiration
My inspiration comes from an arcade game called Battle City, where the game map is also made up of regular squares, with tanks, obstacles, bases and other elements distributed in these squares. It is very similar to the grid layout constructed with color blocks and lines in Mondrian's works.

The colors used by Mondrian in his works are very vivid and bright. He mainly uses three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. It reminds me that most of Google's app logo designs also use this color palette.
